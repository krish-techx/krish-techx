## Expertise
I’ve primarily worked in Waterfall-style development cycles, delivering full-feature releases and refining apps based on real-world feedback from diverse user groups.

Beyond mobile development, I explore Unity and Blender 3D to craft immersive indie games. These creative projects help me bring stories and ideas to life, blending logic with imagination.

Whether it's through building real-world applications or experimenting with game mechanics, I’m committed to developing with purpose — focusing on clean architecture, performance, and meaningful user experiences.

I’m driven by the idea that technology can empower lives, and I’m constantly learning and collaborating to become part of that change.
